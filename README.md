# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the performance of various machine learning methodologies to predict credit card risk.

## Results 
Credit card risk was evaluated using a credit card dataset from Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending services company. The data was oversampled using machine learning algorithms RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, as well as was undersampled using ClusterCentroids. Further, the data was evaluated using a combinatorial approach of over- and under-sampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Lastly, ensemble classifiers BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier were used to predict credit risk. 

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
